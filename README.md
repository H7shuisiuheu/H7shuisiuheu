Creating a full Python implementation of a Ludo game involves several components, including a graphical user interface (GUI) for the game board and pieces. Due to the complexity, I'll provide you with a basic console-based version. You can expand upon it or integrate it with a graphical library for a more interactive experience.

Here's a simplified console-based Ludo game in Python:

import random

class LudoGame:
    def __init__(self):
        self.board = [0] * 40  # Represents the Ludo board
        self.players = ['Player 1', 'Player 2', 'Player 3', 'Player 4']
        self.current_player = 0

    def roll_dice(self):
        return random.randint(1, 6)

    def move_piece(self, player, steps):
        current_position = player['position']
        new_position = (current_position + steps) % 40
        player['position'] = new_position
        self.board[current_position] = 0
        self.board[new_position] = player['id']

    def display_board(self):
        print(self.board)

    def play_turn(self):
        player = self.players[self.current_player]
        input(f"{player}, press Enter to roll the dice.")
        steps = self.roll_dice()
        print(f"{player} rolled a {steps}.")
        self.move_piece(player, steps)
        self.display_board()

    def play_game(self):
        while True:
            self.play_turn()
            input("Press Enter to continue to the next turn.")
            self.current_player = (self.current_player + 1) % len(self.players)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ludo_game = LudoGame()
    ludo_game.play_game()
